# Open Visualization

The Open Visualization Collaboration Space “OpenVis” is a forum within the OpenJS Foundation to neutrally govern the most comprehensive and widely adopted visualization libraries based on JavaScript and WebGL.

This is our website, built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Getting Started

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.

Create an `.env.local` file with the following contents:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="http://localhost:3000/"
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
